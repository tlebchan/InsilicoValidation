# Mutation calling optimisation in bulk WES using in silico approach
## Aim
Explore the use of in silico methods to fine-tune and validate a pipeline for identifying of somatic mutations in Whole Exome Sequencing samples
## Objectives
* Develop pipelines for sample dilution and mutation introduction
* Compare reproducibility of mutation filtration approaches on artificially diluted samples
* Introduce mutations in real samples and compare performance of different mutation approaches
## Methods
## Results
## Conclusions
